Mitchell Duncan - Assignment 1

COMPILATION
Driver.java is the root file of the program, so "javac Driver.java" is sufficient to compile the whole thing

RUNNING
Run "java Driver" and you'll be prompted to enter either "p" or "r".
I didn't really put any serious input handling in this, so anything besides p or r and the program just exits.

The accident location is randomly decided at runtime, but if you choose, you can edit Driver.java line 35
and change xLoc,yLoc to numbers of your choosing within the gridsize. The gridsize can be edited at line 10.

To get verbose movement logging, just pass -d, ala "java Driver -d"
